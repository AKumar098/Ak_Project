**Personalized Healthcare Recommendations**

Project Overview

This project utilizes machine learning to provide personalized healthcare recommendations based on patient data. It analyzes various factors such as demographics, medical history, and lifestyle to suggest lifestyle changes, preventive measures, medications, or treatment plans.

Features

Data preprocessing and visualization

Machine learning model for health risk prediction

Personalized healthcare recommendation system

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score

Scalable for real-time applications

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

Model: Random Forest Classifier

Tools: Colab

Project Structure

├── healthcare_data.csv   # Dataset
├── healthcare_model.py   # Python script for data analysis and ML model
├── README.md             # Project documentation
├── requirements.txt      # Dependencies
└── report.pdf            # Project report (for submission)

Dataset

The dataset includes features like:

Demographics: Age, Gender

Health Indicators: Blood Pressure, Cholesterol, Heart Rate

Lifestyle Factors: Smoking, Exercise, Diet

Target: Health risk classification (0 = Low, 1 = High)

How It Works

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, scaling features

Model Training: Using Random Forest Classifier for predictions

Evaluation: Assess model performance using classification metrics

Recommendation System: Provides tailored healthcare suggestions based on model predictions

Installation & Usage

1. Clone the Repository

  git clone https://github.com/your-username/personalized-healthcare.git
  cd personalized-healthcare

2. Install Dependencies

  pip install -r requirements.txt

3. Run the Script

  python healthcare_model.py

Example Recommendation Output

Personalized Healthcare Recommendation:
- High Risk: Follow a strict treatment plan, take prescribed medications, and maintain a healthy lifestyle.
- Low Risk: Maintain a balanced diet, regular exercise, and periodic health check-ups.

Future Enhancements

Integrating with Electronic Health Records (EHRs)

Enhancing prediction accuracy with Deep Learning models

Deploying as a Web or Mobile Application
